## Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Create OneSignal Account & App

1. **Visit OneSignal Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://onesignal.com/](https://onesignal.com/)
   - Create a free account or sign in

2. **Create New App**
   - Click "New App/Website"
   - Enter your app name: "Nexa Prime"
   - Select "Mobile App"

3. **Note Your App ID**
   - Once created, copy your OneSignal App ID (it looks like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### Step 2: Configure Android Platform

1. **In OneSignal Dashboard:**
   - Select "Android" platform
   - You'll need your Firebase Server Key and Sender ID

2. **Firebase Setup (if not already done):**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or use existing one
   - Add Android app with package name: `com.chainfinance.app`
   - Download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`

3. **Get Firebase Credentials:**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Project Settings > Cloud Messaging
   - Copy the "Server Key" and "Sender ID"
   - Enter these in OneSignal Android configuration

4. **Update Android Configuration:**
   - Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - Replace `YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` with your actual OneSignal App ID
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_PROJECT_NUMBER` with your Firebase Sender ID

### Step 3: Configure iOS Platform

1. **In OneSignal Dashboard:**
   - Select "iOS" platform
   - Upload your iOS Push Certificate or use iOS Push Key

2. **iOS Push Certificate Setup:**
   - Open Keychain Access on Mac
   - Go to Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority
   - Save the CSR file
   - Go to Apple Developer Console > Certificates
   - Create new certificate > Apple Push Notification service SSL
   - Upload the CSR file and download the certificate
   - Upload this certificate to OneSignal

3. **Update iOS Configuration:**
   - Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
   - Replace `YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` with your actual OneSignal App ID

4. **Xcode Configuration:**
   - Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Select the Runner target
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Add "Push Notifications" capability
   - Add "Background Modes" capability and check "Remote notifications"

### Step 4: Update App Code

1. **Update OneSignal App ID in Service:**
   ```bash
   # Open lib/services/onesignal_service.dart
   # Replace "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID" with your actual App ID
   ```

2. **Add Navigation to Notification Settings:**
   - You can add a button in your Settings screen to navigate to notification settings:
   ```dart
   // In your settings screen, add:
   GestureDetector(
     onTap: () => Get.toNamed(Routes.notificationSettings),
     child: // Your notification settings tile
   )
   ```

### Step 5: Test the Integration

1. **Build and Install Debug Version:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test Notification Permission:**
   - Open the app
   - Check if notification permission dialog appears
   - Grant permission when prompted

3. **Send Test Notification:**
   - Go to OneSignal Dashboard
   - Navigate to "Messages" > "Push"
   - Click "New Push"
   - Enter a test message
   - Send to "All Users" or specific segments

4. **Test Deep Linking (Optional):**
   - In OneSignal dashboard, add custom data in "Advanced Settings"
   - Handle the data in `_handleNotificationClick` method in the service

### Step 6: Production Configuration

1. **Android Release Configuration:**
   - Ensure you have a signed release APK
   - The Firebase configuration works for both debug and release

2. **iOS Production Configuration:**
   - Create a Production Push Certificate (not Development)
   - Upload to OneSignal
   - Test with TestFlight builds

### Step 7: Advanced Features (Optional)

1. **User Segmentation:**
   ```dart
   // Set user tags for targeted notifications
   OneSignalService.sendTags({
     'user_type': 'premium',
     'preferred_currency': 'USD',
     'app_version': '1.0.0',
   });
   ```

2. **External User ID:**
   ```dart
   // Link OneSignal user with your user system
   OneSignalService.setExternalUserId(userController.currentUser.id);
   ```

3. **Custom Notification Sounds:**
   - Add sound files to `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`
   - Add sound files to iOS bundle
   - Configure in OneSignal dashboard
